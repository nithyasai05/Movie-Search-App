// Purpose: This is the main entry point for your React application. It sets up the routing between pages using React Router.
// Functionality:
// It includes the routes for different pages like the Home page and MovieDetail page.
// The routes are handled by BrowserRouter and the Route components inside App.jsx.
// This file does not render individual movie details or search results but sets up the routes that load those pages.
// Where it's shown: It handles the routing, meaning it controls which page is shown based on the URL.


// You are correct that when setting up routing in a React application with React Router, it might seem like we can directly reference the components in the route path itself. However, the way the routes are typically set up is to reference **components** using specific paths and **rendering logic** to ensure that different views or pages are shown when the URL changes.

// Here’s a breakdown of why we use the `path` and `element` properties in `Routes` and how it works:

// ### Why not just write components directly in the routes?

// You might be thinking that since we have a `Home` component and `MovieDetail` component, we can just pass them directly without using a `path`. But React Router needs to know **when** to render these components based on the URL (or route). The `path` is essential because it tells React Router **what URL** should trigger the rendering of a specific component.

// ### Explanation of Route Setup:

// 1. **Route Declaration**:
//    In the `App.js` (or `App.jsx`), you define your routes using the `Routes` and `Route` components provided by React Router.

//    ```jsx
//    <Routes>
//      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
//      <Route path="/movie/:id" element={<MovieDetail />} />
//    </Routes>
//    ```

//    Here’s what’s happening:
   
//    - The `path` tells React Router **what URL pattern** to look for. For example:
//      - `/` will trigger the `Home` component.
//      - `/movie/:id` will trigger the `MovieDetail` component, where `:id` is a dynamic parameter representing the movie's ID.
   
//    - The `element` property specifies the **component** that should be rendered when the URL matches the `path`.
//      - `<Home />` will be rendered when the URL matches `/`.
//      - `<MovieDetail />` will be rendered when the URL matches `/movie/:id`.

// 2. **Why Use `path` and `element`**:
//    - **Routing Logic**: By using `path`, React Router knows when to show which component based on the URL. For example, if the user is on `/`, the `Home` component should appear, but if they are on `/movie/123`, then the `MovieDetail` component should appear.
//    - **Dynamic Routing**: The `:id` in the `path` is a **dynamic route parameter**. It’s used to pass different movie IDs to the `MovieDetail` component, which allows React to render a specific movie’s details when the user clicks on a movie card or navigates to a specific movie page.

// 3. **Rendering Components Dynamically**:
//    If you don’t specify the `path` in the `Route` element, React Router won’t know how to trigger the component. It won’t know when to show `Home`, `MovieDetail`, or any other component because it needs a URL path to match.

// ### Example: How Routes Work in `App.js` (or `App.jsx`)

// ```jsx
// import React from "react";
// import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
// import Home from "./Home";
// import MovieDetail from "./MovieDetail";

// function App() {
//   return (
//     <Routes>
//       <Route path="/" element={<Home />} /> {/* This is the Home page when at the root URL */}
//       <Route path="/movie/:id" element={<MovieDetail />} /> {/* This shows MovieDetail when a movie ID is provided */}
//     </Routes>
//   );
// }

// export default App;
// ```

// - **For `/` (Home Page)**: When the user navigates to `/`, React Router will show the `Home` component, which might display a list of movies or other content.

// - **For `/movie/:id` (Movie Detail Page)**: When the user navigates to `/movie/:id`, React Router will show the `MovieDetail` component, passing the movie ID (like `123` or `tt1234567`) via URL parameters. The component will then fetch the data for that specific movie using the ID.

// ### Why Not Just Write `Home` and `MovieDetail` Directly in the `Route`?

// If you were to try to directly render `Home` and `MovieDetail` without specifying `path`, React Router wouldn’t know when to render them based on the URL because it wouldn’t have the necessary logic to match the URL to a component.

// For example, this would **not work**:

// ```jsx
// <Routes>
//   <Route element={<Home />} />
//   <Route element={<MovieDetail />} />
// </Routes>
// ```

// You’d see an error or the wrong component would be rendered because the `path` was not provided, and React Router wouldn’t know which component to show based on the URL.

// ### Recap

// - **`path`** tells React Router when to trigger a route based on the URL.
// - **`element`** is the component that will be rendered when the URL matches the `path`.
// - Without `path`, React Router wouldn’t know when to display the component, and it wouldn't be able to handle navigation correctly.

// By using `path` and `element` together, React Router knows how to match the URL with the appropriate component and render it accordingly.
